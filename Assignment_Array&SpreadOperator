Topic: JavaScript Array Manipulation and Spread Syntax
You are given a set of instructions to manipulate arrays in JavaScript. Your task is to write the code that performs these operations and prints the final results.
Part A: Array Modification
Follow these steps sequentially to modify an array named cities.
Create an array named cities and initialize it with three city names of your choice.
Add two more cities to the end of the array.
Print the current length of the array and all its elements.
Add the string "Delhi" as the first element of the array.
Add the string "Chennai" as the second element of the array.
Add the string "Kolkata" as the last element of the array.
Remove the last element from the array two times (i.e., perform a pop operation twice).
Print the final length of the array and all its elements.
Part B: Combining Arrays with the Spread Operator
Given the following arrays:
Generated code
arr1 = ["Hello", "World"]
arr2 = [1, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 6]
arr4 = ['a', 'j', 't', 'r', 'f']
Use code with caution.
Create a new array named arr3 by combining arr1 and arr2 using the spread operator. arr1's elements should come first.
Create a new array named arr5 by combining arr3 and arr4 using the spread operator. arr3's elements should come first.
Print the final arr3 and arr5 to the console.

// --- Part A: Array Modification ---
console.log("--- Part A Results ---");

// 1. Create an array with 3 cities
let cities = ["Mumbai", "Bengaluru", "Pune"];

// 2. Add two more cities at the end
cities.push("Hyderabad", "Ahmedabad");

// 3. Print the length and all elements
console.log("Length after adding two cities:", cities.length);
console.log("Array:", cities);
// Expected output: Length: 5, Array: [ 'Mumbai', 'Bengaluru', 'Pune', 'Hyderabad', 'Ahmedabad' ]

// 4. Add "Delhi" as the first element
cities.unshift("Delhi");

// 5. Add "Chennai" as the second element
cities.splice(1, 0, "Chennai");

// 6. Add "Kolkata" as the last element
cities.push("Kolkata");

// 7. Do pop two times
cities.pop();
cities.pop();

// 8. Print the final length and all elements
console.log("\nFinal Length:", cities.length);
console.log("Final Array:", cities);
// Expected output: Final Length: 6, Final Array: [ 'Delhi', 'Chennai', 'Mumbai', 'Bengaluru', 'Pune', 'Hyderabad' ]


// --- Part B: Combining Arrays with the Spread Operator ---
console.log("\n--- Part B Results ---");

const arr1 = ["Hello", "World"];
const arr2 = [1, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 6];
const arr4 = ['a', 'j', 't', 'r', 'f'];

// 1. Create arr3 by combining arr1 and arr2
const arr3 = [...arr1, ...arr2];

// 2. Create arr5 by combining arr3 and arr4
const arr5 = [...arr3, ...arr4];

// 3. Print the final arrays
console.log("arr3:", arr3);
console.log("arr5:", arr5);
// Expected output for arr3: [ 'Hello', 'World', 1, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 6 ]
// Expected output for arr5: [ 'Hello', 'World', 1, 3, 9, 5, 4, 9, 6, 'a', 'j', 't', 'r', 'f' ]
