Topic: JavaScript String Manipulation and Regular Expressions
You are given a string containing information about programming languages. 
Your task is to perform a series of find-and-replace operations on this string using JavaScript. 
For some tasks, you will need to use regular expressions to handle case-insensitivity and multiple matches.
Initial String:
"Java Is open source language and Javascript is scripting language. java Is very user-friendly and easy to use"
Your Tasks:
Write a JavaScript script that performs the following four operations on the initial string. 
Print the result of each operation to the console.
Replace only the first occurrence of the word "Java" with "Python".
Replace all words that start with "java" (case-insensitive, e.g., "Java", "Javascript", "java") with the word "python".
Replace all occurrences of the whole word "Java" (case-insensitive, e.g., "Java", "java" but not "Javascript") with "Hello".
Replace all occurrences of the word "is" (case-insensitive, e.g., "Is", "is") with "are".

const originalString = "Java Is open source language and Javascript is scripting language. java Is very user-friendly and easy to use";
console.log("Original String:\n", originalString);

// 1. Replace only "Java" with "Python" on first search
console.log("\n--- Task 1: Replace only the first 'Java' ---");
// The default .replace() method with a string only replaces the first match.
const result1 = originalString.replace("Java", "Python");
console.log(result1);


// 2. Replace all words starting with "java" with "python"
console.log("\n--- Task 2: Replace all words starting with 'java' (case-insensitive) ---");
// We use a regular expression:
// \b     - matches a word boundary.
// java   - the literal text to find at the start of a word.
// \w*    - matches any word character (letters, numbers, _) zero or more times.
// /g     - global flag (to replace all matches, not just the first).
// /i     - case-insensitive flag.
const result2 = originalString.replace(/\bjava\w*/gi, "python");
console.log(result2);


// 3. Replace all words of "Java" in complete string with "Hello"
console.log("\n--- Task 3: Replace all whole words 'Java' (case-insensitive) ---");
// The word boundaries (\b) at both ends ensure we only match the whole word "Java"
// and not the "Java" part of "Javascript".
const result3 = originalString.replace(/\bJava\b/gi, "Hello");
console.log(result3);


// 4. Replace case-insensitive "is" with "are" in complete string
console.log("\n--- Task 4: Replace all 'is' with 'are' (case-insensitive) ---");
// Again, we use word boundaries to avoid replacing "is" inside "Javascript".
const result4 = originalString.replace(/\bis\b/gi, "are");
console.log(result4);
